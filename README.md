# InteractiveBankingSystem
# ABSTRACT
The organization of the banking system is a vital part of everyday life as the economics of whole countries are dependent on it, so creating a reliable program for banks is a topic of current interest. The purpose of this project is to create a secure interactive banking system with a comprehensible interface that organizes transfers, withdrawals, deposits, and changes in the database. The lectures were examined and programming forums were investigated to write and implement the code. Also, the XCode program using the C++ programming code was implemented in order to make the banking system.  The following report includes the description of each class and methods in it separately, starting from the bankSystem class and ending with the main function. As a result, we got an interactive banking system that is capable of transferring, withdrawing, depositing money, and changing the database of users. Also, it can be concluded that all objectives were achieved and an operating program was created that can be actually used in banks to some extent. Nonetheless, this interactive banking system can be improved by creating a more user-friendly interface and also by adding more security levels so that the data of users will be under more protection.
